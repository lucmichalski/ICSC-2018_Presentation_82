# ICSC-2018_Presentation_82
Presentation of the short paper 82 - Multi-Word Structural Topic Modelling of \tor Drug Marketplaces - at The 12th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing

I used RMarkdown and reveljs package and a lot of Gimp editing.

Please look at Yaml at the beginning of the .Rmd file:

output:
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:

If you had any suggestion to have a better and clean presentation please comment!
